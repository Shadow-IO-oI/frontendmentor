# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Clear Js, without Node.js, React.js, Vue.js and other JRE.
- Dynamic adaptive values (that are also written on clear Js)

### What I learned

It was quite hard for me because it was the first time I tried to make a working shop-cart and lightbox gallery. The cart took a lot of time and effort. The main issue I faced was adding additional items to the cart without removing previous values. Additionally, instead of a lightbox gallery, I made a swiper, but I had some problems with positioning it.
