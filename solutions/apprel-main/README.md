# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0).


## Overview

### About The challenge

Design and animations were created by [@visualdenniss](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/visualdenniss).

My solution is a rewritten version of [his code](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/-base-apparel-redesign-super-smooth-gsap-animations-57W7Q7oMU1), using common JavaScript, CSS, and HTML since I do not use React.js. This project was a challenging one for me, as I had to work with new and complex animations. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and improve my skills.

Note that if you are using Chrome DevTools to view the mobile-sized screen, you may need to reload the page to see the animations correctly. If you have any suggestions on how to fix this issue, please feel free to leave a comment.

Thank you, [@visualdenniss](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/visualdenniss)., for the excellent redesign. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¦Š
