								The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
								the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

							<div class="box__text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
								some structure from
								professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
								former
								student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
								staff
								did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
								agile team
								project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
								tutorial
								could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
								developent
								experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
								offers.
								100% recommend! ”</div>
